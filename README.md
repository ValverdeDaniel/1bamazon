# 1bamazon



**OVERVIEW** 

This application is formatted to take a Database named bamazonDB, a table named Products, and the columns of item_ID, product_name, department_name, price, and stock_quantity.

This application is the Basic + the Manager application. 
**FUNCTIONALITY**  

The customer app works exactly as described in the original instructions. On load, it'll load the table and display all items for sale and the coresponding data for each item. If the table looks odd, try expanding the terminal window a little bit. You'll be prompted for item number and desired quantity.

In the customer app if you place an unacceptable amount you will receive the following prompt

The Manager app is a little different. Like the customer app, it lists all items on load. So there's no command offered to list all items for sale. The different commands are "View Products for Sale", "View Low Inventory", "Add to Inventory", "Add New Product". --at the moment They all function properly except for "Add to Inventory".
